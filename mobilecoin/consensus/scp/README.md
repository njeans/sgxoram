# The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)

This crate provides MobileCoin's implementation of SCP, as described in the [whitepaper](https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) drafts [00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mazieres-dinrg-scp-00) and [05](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mazieres-dinrg-scp/).

Stellar provides many materials for understanding SCP, such as [Simplified SCP](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/blog/simplified-scp.html). We recommend [Stellar's guides and materials](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/scp.html), as well as
the [stellar-core implementation](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core).

We also thank BobG, who implemented [SCP in Go](https://github.com/bobg/scp).
